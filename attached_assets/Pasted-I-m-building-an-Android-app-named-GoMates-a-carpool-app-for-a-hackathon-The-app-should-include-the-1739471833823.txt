I'm building an Android app named GoMates, a carpool app for a hackathon. The app should include the following functionalities:

Core Features:

User Authentication:
LoginActivity: Allow users to sign in using email and password.
RegisterActivity: Allow users to register with email and password.
Use Firebase Authentication for handling login/registration.
Main Dashboard:
MainActivity: After logging in, the user should see a dashboard with options to post a ride or view available rides.
Ride Posting & Listing:
RidePostActivity: A screen where users can post ride details including origin, destination, and fare.
RideListActivity: A screen that lists all available rides, using a RecyclerView with a custom adapter and ride_item layout.
Store ride details in Firebase Firestore.
Static Map Integration:
StaticMapActivity (or integrate into another activity): Display a static map image using Googleâ€™s Static Maps API.
Use Glide to load the static map image.
The static map URL should include:
Center coordinates (e.g., latitude 12.9716, longitude 77.5946)
Zoom level 13
Size 600x300 pixels
A marker at the center with a label "A"
An API key placeholder (e.g., YOUR_API_KEY_HERE) that I will replace with my actual key.
Layout Files Required:

activity_login.xml for LoginActivity.
activity_register.xml for RegisterActivity.
activity_main.xml for MainActivity.
activity_ride_post.xml for RidePostActivity.
activity_ride_list.xml for RideListActivity.
ride_item.xml for each ride in the list.
activity_static_map.xml (if using a separate activity for the map) with an ImageView.
Other Requirements:

Include necessary entries in AndroidManifest.xml, like the internet permission.
Provide necessary Gradle dependencies (e.g., Firebase Authentication, Firebase Firestore, Glide).
Use Java as the programming language.
Output:

Complete Java code for each activity.
XML layout files for the mentioned activities.
A sample configuration for AndroidManifest.xml and the Gradle build files.
Please generate the full code and configurations for this project.
